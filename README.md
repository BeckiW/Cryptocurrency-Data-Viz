# Sprint 4, Bitcoin Ticker Assignment

In today's lecture, we walked through how to find a library and figure out how to set it up in a project which uses a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to fetch trade information about Bitcoins in real-time.

If everything went according to plan during the lecture, you should have a project with some sort of graph which visualizes the current trade price of Bitcoin.

This assignment is to take that project, and polish it. What you choose to do is up to you; there's a lot more data in the payload which the WebSocket sends (such as bid price, ask price, 24h high, and 24h low prices). You should use some of these data points to add more to your graph, or set up a secondary graph, or visualize the data in some other way!

Feel free to search for, and set up new external libraries in your project, if you'd like!

## How to complete this assignment

Continue to use the project we worked on during the lecture (in the /code folder of this project). Find a new library to use, or continue to use the library we set up, and add more details to your graph or visualize a new datapoint.

### Hand in the assignment

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code in the "code" folder, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the Technigo one) for review.

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should be comfortable with how to find and use external React libraries you find online. You should also get a little practice using array functions to select and clean data. Hopefully you'll have a little insight into what WebSockets can do, too!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Stretch goals for this project are entirely up to you, and depend very much on what library you chose. Try to find something challenging to implement using the library, or find a new library to set up!

Also, a great stretch goal would be to read up on WebSockets and to try to understand the code in code/src/gdax-websocket.js.
